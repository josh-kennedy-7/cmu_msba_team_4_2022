Tuna is most consumed fish and the second most important fish by wild capture in the world (with 5.2 million metric tons in 2018 ), and the industry around it contributes more that 40 billion dollars to the global economy per year. Even when catch has been increasing year after year, tuna prices have plummeted since 2012 , destroying in the process 1.8 billion dollars in value, not to mention that increased catch threatens the sustainability of the activity. This is aggravated by a lack of international coordination: there is not one single sanctioning body that concentrates efforts on a global context. For example, in the Pacific Ocean, the fastest growth and main producing region of tuna, three different international associations (IATTC , WCPFC  and the CCSBT ) establish the norms for the catch, sometimes with overlap in the areas. Even in a regional scale, lack of coordination is evident: in this year, IATTC did not establish international catch quotas for the eastern Pacific, after its members failed to reach consensus . An accurate and unbiased prediction of prices, paired with other environmental and production models can provide the confidence to work on a global context, and the necessary context to determine the optimal regulatory framework. \n","\n","Price prediction for commodities in general and food supplies in particular is a topic of common interest. Academic research has intensively proposed price and production (catch) prediction models using traditional statistical analysis (e.g. Onour, Ibrahim and Sergi, Bruno, Modeling and forecasting volatility in the global food commodity prices (January 1, 2011)), financial valuation approaches (e.g. Chen, Yu-Chin and Rogoff, Kenneth S. and Rossi, Barbara, Predicting Agri-Commodity Prices: An Asset Pricing Approach (May 10, 2010)), random forests and vector machines (e.g. Dabin Zhang, Shanyin Cheng, Liwen Ling and Qiang Xia, Forecasting Agricultural Commodity Prices Using Model Selection Framework With Time Series Features and Forecast Horizons (February 4, 2020)), and machine learning (e.g. Jabez Harris, A Machine Learning Approach to Forecasting Consumer Food Prices (August 2017)) with different degrees of success. Currently, no method or model is universally accepted as a reliable and standard predictor. \n","\n","Machine Learning is an adequate tool to develop a pricing model, and can potentially surpass the prediction accuracy of other methods. Traditional statistical analysis relies on the assumption of invariability in time, which does not hold in the tuna industry context. Juvenile depletion caused by excess catch, global warming affectations in the life cycle of tuna, and changes in food consumption preferences can all impact pricing. A machine learning model can deal with these circumstances by continuously getting new information and updating its predictions automatically. In this way, an ML model can remain current for the next prediction horizon.
